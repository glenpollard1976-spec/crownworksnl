# 🔍 How to Find Your 2 Vercel Projects

## ⚠️ Status

I **couldn't programmatically list them** because Vercel CLI needs authentication, but I've opened the dashboard for you.

## 🎯 Quick Identification Guide

### Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard
👉 **Already opened in your browser:** https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Step 2: Look for Projects

You should see projects listed. Look for:
- Projects with "crown" in the name
- Projects with "works" in the name  
- Projects with "crownworksnl" or similar
- Any Next.js projects

**Count them:** How many do you see? (Should be 2)

## 🔍 How to Identify Each Project

### Project 1 (Check This One):
1. Click on it
2. Go to **Settings → Git**
3. **What repo is connected?**
   - ✅ `glenpollard1976-spec/crownworksnl` = CORRECT
   - ❌ Something else = WRONG
4. Go to **Settings → Domains**
5. **What domains does it have?**
   - `crownworksnl.com`?
   - `www.crownworksnl.com`?
6. Go to **Deployments**
7. **When was last deployment?** (Recent = good sign)

### Project 2 (Check This One):
1. Click on it
2. Go to **Settings → Git**
3. **What repo is connected?**
   - ✅ `glenpollard1976-spec/crownworksnl` = CORRECT
   - ❌ Something else = WRONG
4. Go to **Settings → Domains**
5. **What domains does it have?**
   - `crownworksnl.com`?
   - `www.crownworksnl.com`?
6. Go to **Deployments**

## ✅ Which One is CORRECT?

**CORRECT PROJECT should have:**
- ✅ Connected to: `glenpollard1976-spec/crownworksnl`
- ✅ Recent deployments (today or this week)
- ✅ Has iLawyer and ProVet sections in the code
- ✅ Latest code we just pushed

**WRONG PROJECT will have:**
